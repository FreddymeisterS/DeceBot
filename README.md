# DeceBot

## How to run

Simply use the `start` npm script to start the bot
```sh
npm start
```

NOTE: `npm` will consume all cli args by default and not pass them on to the script.
If you wish to provide cli args to the bot, `npm` requires you to pass `--` before the args.

**Example**:
```sh
npm start -- --help
```
