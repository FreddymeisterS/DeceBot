This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Prerequisites

This packages uses [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) as it's package manager.
This is to avoid a potential [bug with npm and electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1147#issuecomment-276284477).
Additionally, `yarn` offers many advantages over `npm` such as faster install times and simpler commands (`yarn some-task` vs `npm run some-task`).

To install `yarn`, simply run
```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

## Angular cli commands

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
